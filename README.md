## Mock-Up

Let's start by revisiting the web application's appearance and functionality.

As you can see in the following screenshoot, a user can type a search term (in this case, "star wars") in a search box and the results appear:

The user can save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result, as shown in the following screenshoot:
